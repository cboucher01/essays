This project aims to provide a detailed and visually-appealing timeline of significant events and developments in mercantile and diplomatic relations between England and Russia during the 16th and 17th centuries. The goal of the timeline is to illustrate the interconnectedness of trade and diplomacy by noting trends in correspondence between English and Russian rulers and diplomats as well as important commercial developments between the two nations. Particular attention is paid to the Muscovy Company, an English trading company that had a monopoly on trade between England and Russia from 1555-1698. The project also discusses the relevance of early Anglo-Russian mercantile relations to the British Empire's later dominance in the Atlantic World and considers the existence (or non-existence) of Russian entrepôts.

## Early Anglo-Russian Relations and the Atlantic World

The study of early Anglo-Russian relations can help to contextualize commercial and political trends that helped England develop into a dominant imperial power. More than half a century before English explorers and colonists embarked on voyages to the New World, England was sending exploratory expeditions into the northern seas, including Richard Chancellor's 1533 voyage that landed him in Russia. As historian Felicity Stout points out, England's "discoverie of Russia" was an important step in its development into an imperial power:
> In the early sixteenth-century the Spanish and Portuguese had already ‘discovered’ new lands to the far east and west of the globe. In the case of England, her new ‘discoveries’ were initially to be found in the north, with attempts to explore and navigate north-eastern and north-western passages to the fabled lands of Cathay. In fact, before the English had much contact with the East Indies, the South Seas or the Americas, they had ‘discovered’ and opened trade and diplomatic relations with Russia in the hope of gaining access to lands further east. Thus England’s ventures to find a north-eastern passage, the subsequent ‘discoverie of Russia’ and the later exploration of a route to Persia, via Muscovy and the Caspian Sea, were all significant success stories in the emerging stages of English exploration beyond familiar ports and destinations (Stout 2015, 2).


Furthermore, resources extracted from Russia proved useful for the expansion of England's naval power. For example, cordage from Russia was used to build ships for the English Navy and the East India Company. 

However, as the events of the English Civil War disrupted Anglo-Russian diplomacy and
