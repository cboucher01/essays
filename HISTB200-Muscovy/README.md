# 16th- and 17th-century Anglo-Russian Relations: What's up with that?
Cameron Boucher 

This project aims to provide a detailed and visually-appealing timeline of significant events and developments in mercantile and diplomatic relations between England and Russia during the 16th and 17th centuries. The project also discusses the relevance of these early Anglo-Russian relations to the British Empire's later dominance in the Atlantic World and considers the existence (or non-existence) of Russian entrep√¥ts.
