# 16th- and 17th-century Anglo-Russian Relations: What's up with that?
Cameron Boucher ● 6 May, 2023

This project aims to provide a detailed and visually-appealing timeline of significant events and developments in mercantile and diplomatic relations between England and Russia during the 16th and 17th centuries. Particular attention is paid to the Muscovy Company, an English trading company that had a monopoly on trade between England and Russia from 1555-1698. The project also discusses the relevance of early Anglo-Russian mercantile relations to the British Empire's later dominance in the Atlantic World and considers the existence (or non-existence) of Russian entrepôts.

## Early Anglo-Russian Relations and the Atlantic World

The study of early Anglo-Russian relations can provide a __ perspective on the development of England into a dominant imperial power.

Resources extracted from Russia proved useful for the expansion of England's naval power. For example, cordage from Russia was used to build ships for the English Navy and the East India Company.

> Whereas the state had encouraged the commercial community to drive forward its imperial ambitions in Ireland and Virginia, the limitations of state support and authority encouraged the Muscovy and East India companies to take matters into their own hands.[^?]
