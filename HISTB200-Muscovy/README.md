This project aims to provide a detailed and visually-appealing timeline of significant events and developments in mercantile and diplomatic relations between England and Russia during the 16th and 17th centuries. The goal of the timeline is to illustrate the interconnectedness of trade and diplomacy by noting trends in correspondence between English and Russian rulers and diplomats as well as important commercial developments between the two nations. Particular attention is paid to the Muscovy Company, an English trading company that had a monopoly on trade between England and Russia from 1555-1698. The project also discusses the relevance of early Anglo-Russian mercantile relations to the British Empire's later dominance in the Atlantic World and considers the existence (or non-existence) of Russian entrepôts.

## Early Anglo-Russian Relations and the Atlantic World

The study of early Anglo-Russian relations can help to contextualize mercantile and diplomatic trends that helped England develop into a dominant imperial power.

Resources extracted from Russia proved useful for the expansion of England's naval power. For example, cordage from Russia was used to build ships for the English Navy and the East India Company.
