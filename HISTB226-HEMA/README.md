# Tracing the Recent Growth of Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA)
By Cameron Boucher ● 5 May, 2023

This essay examines the recent growth of Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA). A relatively new sport, HEMA first appeared in the late 1990s, and while it has always been a fairly niche practice, HEMA rose in popularity around the world during the 2010s.[^1] Then, following the COVID-19 pandemic, HEMA clubs and competitions saw a dramatic increase in membership and registration. HEMA's post-pandemic rise in popularity is also evidenced by gear shortages as vendors struggle to meet the increased demand for HEMA equipment. This essay discusses some potential explanations for HEMA's post-pandemic surge in popularity, highlighting the role of the Internet in facilitating the growth of the sport.

## What is HEMA?

Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA), is a form of martial arts based on surviving technical treatises and martial arts manuals from the late middle ages, the Renaissance, and the early modern period. Combatants fight with historically-accurate weaponry—most commonly longswords, rapiers, and sabers, and sometimes with small shields or bucklers—and wear modern protective equipment, including a fencing helmet, a padded fencing jacket, and armored gloves as well as forearm and leg protection. 

HEMA is similar to Historical Medieval Battle (HMB), also known as buhurt, in that it has a competitive element, but it uses modern protective equipment instead of historical equipment, and it places greater emphasis on authenticity of method. Also, HEMA uses a scoring system similar to modern sports fencing, though with some modifications to account for differences in fighting style and weaponry.

Historical research and scholarship are important to the sport. Many HEMA practitioners are as dedicated to researching medieval and early modern swordsmanship and combat as they are to practicing the techniques and engaging in combat themselves. Historian Robert W. Jones argues that, because of this, HEMA is more than a sport or a martial art:

> HEMA is not just a sport or a martial art. More than any of the other ways in which the use of the medieval sword has been recreated, HEMA has promoted the considered and critical study of the historical sources.[^2] 

According to Jones, there are an increasing number of "scholarly practitioners" of HEMA, who combine traditional academic methods of historical research with their HEMA practice. These scholars have built a body of research around the surviving historical *fechtbücher*, or combat manuals, seeking to situate them in their historical context.

As yet, there is no single international governing body for HEMA tournaments and events, although many national and international organizations exist. Tournaments are generally run and hosted by individual clubs. It is also worth noting that not every HEMA club belongs to a national or international organization, and not every HEMA practitioner is a member of a club. In fact, some HEMA practitioners remain fiercely independent of clubs and organizations, preferring to study and practice historical martial arts independently or in small, closed groups with other scholars.

## The Post-Pandemic HEMA Surge

While HEMA remains a relatively small, niche sport, it has seen a surge in popularity since the COVID-19 pandemic. HEMA practitioners report in online forums that their clubs and classes have doubled in size since the pandemic, and they continue to grow. HEMA practitioners also report shortages of gear as vendors struggle to produce enough gear to keep up with demand. Some report that new club members are seeing a six month wait for gear like sparring gloves, whereas such delays were not seen prior to the pandemic.[^3] So why did the pandemic cause HEMA to gain popularity?

### Lockdowns and Martial Arts

It is possible that, as a result of nationwide lockdowns and mandates restricting in-person gatherings, the pandemic caused practitioners of martial arts that were more difficult to practice under these restrictions to pivot to other martial arts. Because HEMA is a weapons-based martial art and combatants are more distanced from each other during practice than in some other martial arts, HEMA clubs were more likely to continue to practice in person during the pandemic than other martial arts clubs. Instructors who teach forms of martial arts that lend themselves better to socially-distanced classes, such as striking arts like taekwondo and kickboxing and weapons-based arts like HEMA and fencing, reported that practitioners of other, less social-distancing-friendly martial arts, including grappling styles like judo, aikido, and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, joined their classes during the pandemic, while their usual classes were cancelled.[^4]

### The Role of the Internet

In addition to causing a shift in which martial arts were being practice during the pandemic, the lockdown also encouraged martial arts practitioners to pivot to online classes, making use of both pre-recorded instructional videos and live video classes. Instructors report making adjustments to their curriculums and teaching methods to be able to continue offering classes during the pandemic.

One study into the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the practice of various martial arts suggests that the pandemic may have accelerated market trends that were visible prior to the start of the global health crisis. One such trend is "the increased importance of digital media within martial arts instruction."[^5] While many martial arts classes moved to an entirely digital format during the lockdowns with the intention of returning to fully in-person instruction once restrictions eased, the study reports that many of its participants "have recognised the benefits of online teaching and intended to combine it with conventional on-site methods of training."[^6] These benefits include the ability to hold classes that can be attended by people, regardless of their physical proximity to a club or studio, allowing individual instructors to teach more students and expand their clubs internationally, should they choose to do so.

It also seems likely that, because many people spent significantly more time online during the pandemic, they may have been more likely to encounter HEMA content on social media and become interested in the sport, joining online HEMA communities and eventually attending in-person classes and tournaments as restrictions on indoor gatherings eased. In other words, as HEMA communities moved online and people in general began to spend more time on the Internet, HEMA may have become visible to more people, generating interest in the niche sport. 

It is worth noting that, given the fact that HEMA first arose in the late 1990s, around the same time as such groundbreaking digital technologies as Google Search, the Internet has played a significant role in the development of the sport from the very start. According to Robert Jones, the Internet has proved instrumental for HEMA:

> HEMA benefited from the fact that it was developing alongside an ever-increasing reach of the internet. This provided opportunities to create effective web forums, allowed for the creation of an international community, and enabled a huge expansion in the exchange of sources, knowledge, theories, and practice.[^7]

Thanks to the Internet, the HEMA community has experienced significant growth in the past decades. One result of this growth has been the identification, transcription, translation, and interpretation of a large body of combat manuals in both physical and online formats. Another notable development was the emergence of professional instructors who are able to make a living teaching HEMA. In addition, the equipment used in HEMA has rapidly advanced over the years. In less than ten years, practitioners have gone from using wooden wasters or steel swords for reenactment, and makeshift forms of body protection such as motorcycle and ice hockey armor, to using nylon wasters, steel feders, and protective gear specifically designed for HEMA by well-known sports fencing equipment manufacturers. 

Ultimately, it seems that the pandemic, by increasing the relevance of online communication and internet commerce, served to accelerate these pre-existing trends and speed the growth of HEMA as a global sport. While HEMA remains a fairly niche sport, it is possible that, as the Internet becomes an increasingly important part of martial arts practice and life in general, HEMA will continue to grow in popularity around the world.
