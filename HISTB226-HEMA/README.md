## The Post-Pandemic HEMA Surge

HEMA fencers (what are people who do HEMA called?) report in online forums that their clubs and classes have doubled in size since the pandemic, and they continue to grow. Interestingly, however, they do not link this growth to online HEMA communities, as many HEMA clubs and groups have moved their online discussions from public platforms, such as Facebook and Reddit, to private Discord servers.

HEMA fencers report shortages of gear as vendors struggle to produce enough gear to keep up with demand. Some report that new club members are seeing a six month wait for gear like sparring gloves, whereas such delays were not seen prior to the pandemic.

### Why did the pandemic cause HEMA to gain popularity?

Theory 1: During the pandemic, people spent more time online, where they encountered HEMA content and became interested in the sport, joining online HEMA communities and eventually attending in-person classes and tournaments as restrictions on indoor gatherings eased.

Theory 2: HEMA, as a form of historical reenactment, appeals to popular interest in make-believe and escapism, which rose in response to the pandemic.
