# Tracing the Recent Growth of Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA)
By Cameron Boucher ● 5 May, 2023

This essay examines the recent growth of Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA). A relatively new sport, HEMA first appeared in the late 1990s, and while it has always been a fairly niche practice, HEMA rose in popularity around the world during the 2010s.[^1] Then, following the COVID-19 pandemic, HEMA clubs and competitions saw a dramatic increase in membership and registration. HEMA's post-pandemic rise in popularity is also evidenced by gear shortages as vendors struggle to meet the increased demand for HEMA equipment. This essay discusses some potential explanations for HEMA's post-pandemic surge in popularity, highlighting the role of the Internet in facilitating the growth of the sport.

## What is HEMA?

Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA), is a form of martial arts based on surviving technical treatises and martial arts manuals from the late middle ages, the Renaissance, and the early modern period. Combatants fight with historically-accurate weaponry—most commonly longswords, rapiers, and sabers, and sometimes with small shields or bucklers—and wear modern protective equipment, including a fencing helmet, a padded fencing jacket, and armored gloves as well as forearm and leg protection. 

HEMA is similar to Historical Medieval Battle (HMB), also known as buhurt, in that it has a competitive element, but it uses modern protective equipment instead of historical equipment, and it places greater emphasis on authenticity of method. Also, HEMA uses a scoring system similar to modern sports fencing, though with some modifications to account for differences in fighting style and weaponry.

Historical research and scholarship are important to the sport. Many HEMA practitioners are as dedicated to researching medieval and early modern swordsmanship and combat as they are to practicing the techniques and engaging in combat themselves. Historian Robert W. Jones argues that, because of this, HEMA is more than just a sport or a martial art:

> HEMA is not just a sport or a martial art. More than any of the other ways in which the use of the medieval sword has been recreated, HEMA has promoted the considered and critical study of the historical sources.[^2] 

According to Jones, there are an increasing number of "scholarly practitioners" of HEMA, who combine traditional academic methods of historical research with their HEMA practice. These scholars have built a body of research around the surviving historical *fechtbücher*, or combat manuals, seeking to situate them in their historical context.

As yet, there is no single international governing body for HEMA tournaments and events, although many national and international organizations exist. Tournaments are generally run and hosted by individual clubs. It is also worth noting that not every HEMA club belongs to a national or international organization, and not every HEMA practitioner is a member of a club. In fact, some HEMA practitioners remain fiercely independent of clubs and organizations, preferring to study and practice historical martial arts independently or in small, closed groups with other scholars.

## The Post-Pandemic HEMA Surge

While HEMA remains a relatively small, niche sport, it has seen a surge in popularity since the COVID-19 pandemic. HEMA practitioners report in online forums that their clubs and classes have doubled in size since the pandemic, and they continue to grow. HEMA practitioners also report shortages of gear as vendors struggle to produce enough gear to keep up with demand. Some report that new club members are seeing a six month wait for gear like sparring gloves, whereas such delays were not seen prior to the pandemic.[^3] So why did the pandemic cause HEMA to gain popularity?

### Lockdowns and Martial Arts

It is possible that, as a result of nationwide lockdowns and mandates restricting in-person gatherings, the pandemic caused practitioners of martial arts that were more difficult to practice under these restrictions to pivot to other martial arts. Because HEMA is a weapons-based martial art and combatants are more distanced from each other during practice than in some other martial arts, HEMA clubs were more likely to continue to practice in person during the pandemic than other martial arts clubs. Instructors who teach forms of martial arts that lend themselves better to socially-distanced classes, such as striking arts like taekwondo and kickboxing and weapons-based arts like HEMA and fencing, reported that practitioners of other, less social-distancing-friendly martial arts, including grappling styles like judo, aikido, and Brazialian jiu-jitsu, joined their classes during the pandemic, while their usual classes were cancelled.[^4]

### The Role of the Internet

In addition to causing a shift in which martial arts were being practice during the pandemic, the lockdown also encouraged martial arts practitioners to pivot to online classes, relying on both pre-recorded instructional videos and live video classes. Instructors report making adjustments to their curriculums and teaching methods to be able to continue offering classes during the pandemic.

One study into the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the practice of various martial arts suggests that the pandemic may have accelerated market trends that were visible prior to the start of the global health crisis. One such trend is "the increased importance of digital media within martial arts instruction."[^5] While many martial arts classes moved to an entirely digital format during the lockdowns with the intention of returning to fully in-person instruction once restrictions eased, the study reports that many of its participants "have recognised the benefits of online teaching and intended to combine it with conventional on-site methods of training."[^6] These benefits include the ability to hold classes that can be attended by people, regardless of their physical proximity to a club or studio, allowing individual instructors to teach more students and expand their clubs internationally, should they so choose.

It also seems likely that, during the pandemic, people spent more time online, where they may have encountered HEMA content on social media, for example, and became interested in the sport, joining online HEMA communities and eventually attending in-person classes and tournaments as restrictions on indoor gatherings eased.
