# Tracing the Modernization and Recent Growth of Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA)
By [Cameron Boucher](https://cboucher01.github.io/) ● 27 April, 2023

This essay chronicles the development of Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) into a modern sport. HEMA, which has always been a fairly niche sport, gradually rose in popularity around the world during the 2010s. Then, following the COVID-19 pandemic, HEMA clubs and competitions saw a dramatic increase in membership and registration. HEMA's post-pandemic rise in popularity is also evidenced by gear shortages as vendors struggle to meet the increased demand for HEMA equipment. This essay discusses some potential explanations for HEMA's post-pandemic surge in popularity, highlighting the role of the Internet in facilitating the growth of the sport.

## What is HEMA?

Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA), is a form of martial arts based on surviving technical treatises and martial arts manuals from the late middle ages, the Renaissance, and the early modern period. Combatants fight with historically-accurate weaponry—most commonly longswords, rapiers, and sabers, and sometimes with small shields or bucklers—and wear modern protective equipment, including a fencing helmet, a padded fencing jacket, and armored gloves as well as forearm and leg protection. 

Historical research and scholarship are important to the sport. Many HEMA practitioners are as dedicated to researching medieval and early modern swordsmanship and combat as they are to practicing the techniques and engaging in combat themselves.

As yet, there is no international governing body for HEMA tournaments and events, although national governing bodies exist in some countries. Tournaments are generally run and hosted by individual clubs. While HEMA remains a relatively small, niche sport, it has seen a surge in popularity since the COVID-19 pandemic.

## The Post-Pandemic HEMA Surge

HEMA practitioners report in online forums that their clubs and classes have doubled in size since the pandemic, and they continue to grow. Interestingly, however, they do not link this growth to online HEMA communities, as many HEMA clubs and groups have moved their online discussions from public platforms, such as Facebook and Reddit, to more private online spaces.

HEMA practitioners also report shortages of gear as vendors struggle to produce enough gear to keep up with demand. Some report that new club members are seeing a six month wait for gear like sparring gloves, whereas such delays were not seen prior to the pandemic.

### Why did the pandemic cause HEMA to gain popularity?

Hypothesis 1: During the pandemic, people spent more time online, where they encountered HEMA content and became interested in the sport, joining online HEMA communities and eventually attending in-person classes and tournaments as restrictions on indoor gatherings eased.

Hypothesis 2: HEMA, as a form of historical reenactment, appeals to popular interest in make-believe and escapism, which rose in response to the pandemic.
